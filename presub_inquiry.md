Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death among cancers in the United States [ref]. Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater than 90% chance of survival, less than half of individuals adhere to screening recommendations because the standard diagnostic, colonoscopy, is expensive and invasive [ref]. Thus, there is a great need to improve the sensitivity of current non-invasive tests to detect adenomas. Numerous studies have demonstrated a causal linkage between  the formation of colonic lesions and the activity of the gut microbiota in tissue culture and animal models [refs]. These studies have been complemented by studies in human populations identifying shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota that are associated with the progression of colorectal cancer [refs]. These results suggest that the gut microbiota could represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Using stool samples from 490 patients we developed a cross-validated random forest classification model that detects colonic lesions using the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the FIT. The microbiome-based random forest model detected 95.0% of cancers and 61.1% of adenomas while the FIT detected 75.0% and 15.7% for FIT, respectively. Of the colonic lesions missed by FIT, the model detected 80.0% of cancers and 53.9% of adenomas. With a negative predictive value of 99.98%, our model could be used to accurately identify those patients for whom a colonoscopy is unnecessary, drastically reducing healthcare costs and complications due to invasive screening and ultimately decreasing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer.
